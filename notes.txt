Assignment: Building a Django Chat Application with Gemini API Integration
Objective:
Develop a Python Django application that acts as a chat interface, allowing users to enter queries which are then sent to the Gemini API to retrieve responses. The chat interface should resemble WhatsApp, and the application should maintain separate conversations for multiple users without intermingling the chats. Additionally, the application should display the last three queries and responses along with the new ones for better context.

Project Requirements:
Set Up Environment:
Install Django and any other necessary libraries.
Set up a Django project and create an application within it.
User Interface:
Create a chat interface that resembles WhatsApp, allowing users to enter queries and view responses.
Display the last three queries and responses along with the new ones for better context.
Integration with Gemini API:
Implement functionality to send user queries to the Gemini API.
Retrieve responses from the Gemini API and display them in the chat interface.
Multiple Chat Sessions:
Ensure that multiple users can chat simultaneously without their conversations getting intermingled.
Implement logic to maintain separate chat sessions for each user.


Steps to Complete the Assignment:
1. Set Up Django Environment
Install Django:
Use pip to install Django and any other required dependencies.
Set up a new Django project and create a new application within it.
2. Design User Interface
Create Chat Interface:
Design a chat interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that resembles WhatsApp.
Include input fields for users to enter queries and display areas to show responses.
Display Previous Conversations:
Implement logic to display the last three queries and responses along with the new ones.
Ensure that the chat interface provides a smooth and intuitive user experience.
3. Integrate with Gemini API
Set Up Gemini API Integration:
Obtain API credentials and set up authentication for accessing the Gemini API.
Use Django's built-in HTTP client or third-party libraries like requests to send queries to the Gemini API.
Send Queries and Display Responses:
Implement functionality to send user queries to the Gemini API.
Retrieve responses from the Gemini API and display them in the chat interface.
4. Manage Multiple Chat Sessions
Session Management:
Implement logic to manage separate chat sessions for multiple users.
Ensure that each user's chat history is maintained separately without getting intermingled with others.
5. Testing
Test Chat Interface:
Test the chat interface by simulating user interactions and ensuring that queries are sent to the Gemini API and responses are displayed correctly.
Verify that the application maintains separate chat sessions for multiple users.
6. Documentation
Provide Clear Instructions:
Document the steps to set up and run the Django application.
Include instructions on how to interact with the chat interface and test its functionality.
Deliverables:
Django Application:
Django project and application code containing the chat interface and Gemini API integration logic.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript Files:
Files for the chat interface design.
Documentation:
Detailed documentation on setting up, running, and testing the Django application.
Explanation of the Gemini API integration and chat session management logic.
Tips:
Use Django Channels: Consider using Django Channels to enable WebSocket communication for real-time chat updates.
Focus on UX: Pay attention to the user experience and design an intuitive chat interface.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for API requests and other potential issues.
Security: Ensure that sensitive data, such as API credentials, is handled securely.
Scalability: Design the application to handle multiple users and scale as needed.
By completing this assignment, you will demonstrate your ability to develop a real-time chat application using Django and integrate it with external APIs like the Gemini API, showcasing skills in web development, API integration, and user interface design.
